If you only know yourself, but not your opponent, you may win or may lose. If you know neither yourself nor your enemy, you will always endanger yourself.</p>

        <p>The Auraria Library website at http://library.auraria.edu, directing 2 millions page views traffic per year, is the main information portal that leads to a wealth of resources and services provided by the Library. </p>
        <p>The current version of the library website, built with Content Management System (CMS) Drupal 6, is 6 years old. In Feb 2016, Drupal 6 has also reached its end of life, which means, the library website needs to be migrated away from this outdated technology with the highest priority. Because the needs of library users as well as the underlying technology of CMS have all evolved greatly within the last 6 years, it is not possible to just migrate content from the old system into the new. The prudent path forward would be to utilize the latest technology to completely redesign and rebuild the main library website from the ground up. </p>
